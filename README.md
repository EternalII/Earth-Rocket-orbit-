# Earth Rocket Orbit

An OpenGL project rendering a rocket's orbit around Earth.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: Real-time rendering of Earth's sphere and the rocket's trajectory.
- **User Interaction**: Controls to adjust the rocket's parameters and view.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EternalII/Earth-Rocket-orbit-.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Earth-Rocket-orbit-
   ```
3. **Open the project**:
   - Open the solution file `SpaceCube v8 Submit` in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).

4. **Build and run the project**:
   - Build the solution and start the application from your IDE.

## Requirements

- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio or any compatible C# IDE.
- **Libraries**: Ensure OpenGL libraries are properly installed and configured.

## Usage

- **Controls**: Use the arrow keys to control the animation and to change view direction of the earth
- **Visualization**: Observe the rocket's orbit and analyze its path around Earth.

There's a need to seperate the controls from the animation and the camera view angel, which I might come around to do that eventually (most likely not)
